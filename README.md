# UGPAY (WiFi Billing System)

UGPAY is a robust, multi-tenant WiFi billing and management system designed for ISPs and Hotspot owners in Uganda. It allows admins to manage packages, sell vouchers, and accept Mobile Money payments automated via Relworx.

## 🚀 Features (Version 1.1)

### 🖥️ Admin Dashboard
-   **Router Analytics & Filtering**: Filter transactions, statistics, and charts by specific Router ID. Perfect for multi-location management.
-   **Security**: Secure Login with JWT authentication, error toasts, and auto-redirection.
-   **UI/UX**: Dark mode aesthetic, responsive design with **Mobile Hamburger Menu** and **Desktop Sidebar Toggle**.
-   **Performance**: **Client-side caching** for instant smooth navigation between views.

### 💰 Payment & Finance
-   **SMS Integration**: Purchase SMS credits via Relworx Mobile Money.

-   **Real-time Stats**: Track Daily/Weekly Revenue, Voucher Sales, and SMS Balance instantly.
-   **Detailed History**: Filter transaction history by Router to see exactly where revenue is coming from.

### 🎟️ Voucher & Package Management

### ⚙️ System
